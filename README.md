# DesignPatterns
### The project includes examples of implementing design patterns using C# and UML diagrams.
- Simple diagrams, easy to understand
- Diagrams for each pattern
- The most used design patterns in c# are selected

#### Using design patterns is not a mandatory requirement, but they are powerful tools that can help you create code that is cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain!
